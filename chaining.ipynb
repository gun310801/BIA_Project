       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-Q4-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Note  2 – Revenue\\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is \\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue \\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \\nnet sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024 , 2023  and 2022  were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489 \\nMac  29,984  29,357  40,177 \\niPad  26,694  28,300  29,292 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories  37,005  39,845  41,241 \\nServices (1) 96,169  85,200  78,129 \\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sale s price of certain p roducts.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion  of revenue recognized in 2024  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, \\n2023 , $8.2 billion  of revenue recognized in 2023  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022 , and $7.5 \\nbillion  of revenue recognized in 2022  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021 .\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 35'),\n",

Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa01, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 50')]"
