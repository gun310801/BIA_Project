The offerings provide \\npriority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement \\nservices, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country \\nand type of product.\\nCloud Services\\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and \\nWindows personal computers.\\nDigital Content\\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications \\nand digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game  subscription  \\nservice; Apple Fitness+SM, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with \\non-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive \\noriginal content and live sports.\\nPayment Services\\nThe Company offers payment services, including A pple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment \\nservice.\\nSegments\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the \\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \\ndynamics of each geographic region.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \\nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution \\nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024 , the Company’s net \\nsales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of \\nthe Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating \\nthe Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-Q4-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its h ardwar e, \\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of \\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such \\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such \\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \\nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \\naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \\non reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-Q4-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believ es that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best \\ntalent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its \\npeople can do the best work of their lives. As of September\\xa0 28, 2024 , the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time \\nequivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \\nvariety of benefits for employees a round the w orld, including health, wellness and time away.\\nGrowth an d Developme nt\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs \\nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can \\nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal developmen t, as well as learning opportunities to \\nsupport their well-bei ng.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \\nharassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities \\nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \\nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \\nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \\nenvironments.

This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking \\nstatements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \\nand Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial \\nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and \\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition .\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. \\nIn addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including \\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend \\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher \\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely \\naffect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially \\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset \\nvalues, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global \\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial \\ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the \\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced \\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.

Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \\ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly \\nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its \\nrevenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products \\nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including \\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, \\nservice s and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with \\nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s \\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company \\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company’s business.

Global climate change is resulting in \\ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the \\nCompany’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear \\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity \\nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains \\ncan be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create \\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s \\nservice offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \\nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. \\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales \\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays \\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

The Company has also outsourced \\nmuch of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the \\nCompany’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future \\nhave an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the \\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for \\nproduct defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-\\nwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While \\nthe Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from \\ntime to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s \\nhardware products.  Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of \\ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \\ndisputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, \\ngeopolitical tension s, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of \\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and \\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \\nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \\nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial \\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the \\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  Therefore, the \\nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing \\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has \\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business \\nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 8'),\n",

Globally, attacks \\nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques \\nthat are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the \\nCompany’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers \\ncan escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many \\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and \\nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent \\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of \\nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all \\neventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password \\nmanagement or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other \\nthird parties’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be \\nused for unauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect \\ncustomers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors \\nits services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other \\nthings, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such \\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not \\noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and \\nfinancial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions.

In addition, agreements \\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \\nnew claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and \\nother patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on \\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending \\ninfringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these \\nactions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company \\nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance \\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly \\nincrease the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and \\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services .\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \\nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s \\nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an \\noutcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or \\ninjunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change \\nits business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products  and \\nservices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial \\ncondition.\\nWhile  the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to \\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; \\nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services \\nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and \\nartificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; \\navailability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; \\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and \\nenvironmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or \\nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for \\nthe Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing \\nlaws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These \\nrisks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including \\nhealth and financial  service s, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial \\nintelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The \\nCompany has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but \\nthere can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the \\nCompany’s policies and procedures.

Although the Company \\nhas programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance \\nthat such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s \\nproducts could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose \\nthe Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s \\nbusiness.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \\nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals \\nand initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other \\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the \\nCompany’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its \\nannounced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the \\nCompany’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, \\nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and \\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings \\nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial \\ncondition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, \\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes \\nin the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers \\nwithin apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company  has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the \\nDMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution \\nfor iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional \\ntools and APIs for developers . The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to \\nfeedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is \\nintended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private \\nlitigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for  noncompliance, and  other jurisdictions may seek to require the \\nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new \\nprivacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can \\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially \\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject \\nto civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance \\nsmartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of \\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are \\nresolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes \\nto its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations \\nand financial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \\nresults of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google \\nLLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these \\narrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 14'),\n",

Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \\nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance \\nwith these obligations.

For example, \\nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \\ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \\nacquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \\neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \\ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \\nservices with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \\nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \\nCompany’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 15'),\n",

The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \\neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not \\ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to \\ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \\nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \\noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \\ncomponents. As of September\\xa028, 2024 , the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \\nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \\nadditional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \\nnumber of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies \\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio \\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase \\nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \\ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa028, 2024  and \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023  (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive InstrumentHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089 \\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139 $ 194 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \\nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \\nprohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 \\nmillion and $669 million as of September\\xa028, 2024  and September\\xa030, 2023 , respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying \\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \\nCompany’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 27'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-Q4-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Note  2 – Revenue\\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is \\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue \\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \\nnet sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024 , 2023  and 2022  were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489 \\nMac  29,984  29,357  40,177 \\niPad  26,694  28,300  29,292 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories  37,005  39,845  41,241 \\nServices (1) 96,169  85,200  78,129 \\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sale s price of certain p roducts.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion  of revenue recognized in 2024  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, \\n2023 , $8.2 billion  of revenue recognized in 2023  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022 , and $7.5 \\nbillion  of revenue recognized in 2022  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021 .\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 35'),\n",

Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa01, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 50'),\n",

The Company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s \\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

Capitalized terms are \\ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \\nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \\npaid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “ Award \\nAgreement ” applicable to the Award.\\n2. RSUs .  As used herein, the term “ RSU ” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \\nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \\nof the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the \\nShares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. \\nThe RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or \\nas a trust fund of any kind.\\n3. Vesting .  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \\nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \\nto herein as a “ Vesting Date. ”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \\nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \\nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \\nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \\nforfeited.\\n4. Continuance of Employment .  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \\nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \\nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \\nbenefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \\nAward Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial \\nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this \\nAward Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other \\nthan a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of \\nabsence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

The Participant shall have no \\nrights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) \\nwith respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the RSUs or any Shares \\nunderlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record \\nby the Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the \\nrecord date is prior to the date of issuance of Shares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such \\nShares.\\n(b) Dividend Equivalent Rights .

Any \\nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \\nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \\nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \\namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend \\nEquivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the \\nrecord date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to \\nSection 8.\\n6.

Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs .  On or as soon as administratively practical \\nfollowing each vesting event pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \\none-half (2 ½) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \\nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event, less Tax-\\nRelated Items.

The Participant shall have no further rights \\nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\\n8. Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \\nSection 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \\nthe extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of \\nService, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the \\nCompany or one of its Subsidiaries (the “ Severance Date ”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s \\nTermination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the \\nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date \\nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash \\nequivalent.

By accepting this Award, the \\nParticipant further agrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order \\nto comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent that the terms of this Agreement and any \\nCompany recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is \\nnot the Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\\n10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events .  Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to \\nthe Company’s stock contemplated by Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an \\nextraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in accordance with \\nsuch section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be \\nissued in respect of the Award.

As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary \\ncash dividend on its Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i)\\xa0the \\nper share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii)\\xa0the total target \\nnumber of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the \\nAward that are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “ Dividend Equivalent Right ”). Any \\nDividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be \\nsubject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to \\nwhich they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the \\namount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the \\npercentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total \\ntarget number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A . No crediting of \\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, \\nas of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated \\npursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A .\\n6. Restrictions on Transfer .  Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, \\nthe Dividend Equivalent Rights and any interest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof \\nshall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of, alienated or encumbered, \\neither voluntarily or involuntarily.\\n7. Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs .  On or as soon as administratively practical \\nfollowing the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and \\none-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of \\nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-\\nRelated Items. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to \\nthe condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares \\nwith respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or \\nassurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights \\nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\\n8. Effect of Termination of Service .  Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this \\nSection 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to \\nthe extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s Termination of \\nService, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the \\nCompany or one of its Subsidiaries (the “ Severance Date ”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s \\nTermination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the \\nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date \\nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash \\nequivalent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to \\nthe Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the Vesting Date, on the \\nVesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend \\nEquivalent Rights) determined by multiplying (i)\\xa0the RSUs subject to the Award that would have otherwise \\nvested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but for the Termination of Service and to the extent \\nthe applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii)\\xa0 the Severance Fraction \\n2'),\n",

(the “Committee”), and \\ncovers Incentive-Based Compensation granted, awarded or paid by Apple Inc. or any of \\nits subsidiaries (“Apple”) to any employee who is an “executive officer” of Apple (each a \\n“Covered Executive”) as defined under Section 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange \\nAct\\xa0 of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Policy is intended to comply with, and as applicable \\nto be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the exceptions set \\nforth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule \\n10D-1 under the Exchange Act (collectively referred to herein as “Rule 10D-1”). For \\navoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered Executives who served as a \\nCovered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any \\nIncentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy \\nexplains when Apple will be required to seek recovery of erroneously awarded \\nIncentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.  \\nB.Incentive-Based Compensation\\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation \\ngranted, earned or vested based in whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more \\nfinancial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) \\nby a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance \\nperiod for the Incentive-Based Compensation. Financial reporting measures are (i) any \\nmeasure(s) that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting \\nprinciples used in Apple’s financial statements and any measure(s) derived in whole or \\nin part from such measure(s) and (ii) any measure(s) that are based in whole or in part \\non Apple’s stock price or total shareholder return. For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-\\nBased Compensation includes awards granted to a Covered Executive that are \\noutstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is \\n“Received” in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained \\nregardless of when it is paid or awarded.\\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested \\nbased on the attainment of one or more financial measures, including but not limited to \\ntime-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation under this Policy but \\nmay be recouped under the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment \\nPolicy. Exhibit 97.1'),\n",

If the Committee determines \\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded and recovery is required \\npursuant to this Policy, Apple shall make any required disclosures for any affected \\nCovered Executives in its annual proxy statement. Apple will maintain and will provide to \\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in \\ncomplying with the Policy.  Any determinations made by the Committee under this \\nPolicy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.  \\nD.Section 10D-1 Recovery \\nPursuant to Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make reasonable efforts to recover any \\nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by any Covered Executive during the three \\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Apple is required to prepare \\nan Accounting Restatement under Rule 10D-1 and any transition period of less than \\nnine months that is within or immediately following such three years if the Committee \\ndetermines the Incentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. An \\n“Accounting Restatement” is a correction to Apple’s financial statements that, due to \\nApple’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. \\nfederal securities laws, is (1) is material to a prior financial reporting period or (2) would \\nbe material to the current financial reporting period if corrected in the current period or \\nleft uncorrected in the current period.  \\nRecovery will be limited to the amount of the gross, pre-tax, Incentive-Based \\nCompensation that was erroneously Received because it exceeded the amount that \\nwould have been Received had it been determined based on any restated financial \\nmeasures in the Accounting Restatement. If the Incentive-Based Compensation is \\nbased on stock price or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a \\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement, if any, on the stock \\nprice or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether \\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. \\nIf the erroneo usly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered \\nbecause recovery  efforts are excessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the \\ncost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to laws outside the United \\nStates, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a \\ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders’ best interests \\nand should continue or would otherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\\n2'),\n",

In addition, some of the Company’ s competitors have broader product lines,\\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\\nlowered product margins . Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\\nCompany’ s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’ s product features and applications within their products, or\\ncollaborate to of fer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently of fer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Com pany’ s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\\nsingle or limited sources .

For example,\\ntensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business\\nrestrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’ s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can\\nadversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’ s products more expensive for customers, which\\ncould make the Company’ s products less compe titive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or\\nexports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’ s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’ s ability to offer its products\\nand services as designe d. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’ s operation s in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’ s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company\\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all advers e impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in\\nresponse could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ s business.

Such events can make it difficult or impossible for\\nthe Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’ s supply and manufacturing chain, and\\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Compa ny’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery\\ntime, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

In some circumstances, for\\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar ’s strengthening, which would adversely affect\\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely , a strengthening of foreign currencies  relative to the U.S. dollar , while generally beneficial to the Company’ s foreign currency–denominated sales and\\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\\nAdditionally , strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’ s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\\naffecting gross margins.\\nThe Compan y uses derivative instruments, such  as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency\\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more  than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’ s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity , credit deteriorat ion, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’ s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and\\nnon-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially . Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\\nand marketa ble and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on\\nthe Company’ s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Compa ny is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certai n of its services through third-party cellular netw ork carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\\nCompany’ s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\\nportion of the Company’ s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’ s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is highe r in certain international markets and its ability  to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\\nassemble final products for the Company . In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\\ninventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’ s vendor non-trade receivables  and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\\ntrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and\\navoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject  to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland , where a number of the Company’ s subsidiaries are organized.\\nDue to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to\\nsignificant change. The Company’ s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the\\nvaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The\\napplication of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to dif fering interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16'),\n",

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’ s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the\\nU.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’ s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’ s\\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely af fected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’ s stock is subject to volatility .\\nThe Company’ s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally , the Company , the technology\\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies’  operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\\nits stock in a given perio d to exceed the stock’ s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\\ngrowth and profitability . The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow ,\\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’ s Board of Directors, and\\nthe Company’ s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to\\nfuture growth, profitability , dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’ s stock may decline significantly , which could\\nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 2.    Properties\\nThe Company’ s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate\\nfunctions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its\\nexisting facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\nItem 3.

(“Epic ”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the\\nCompany alleging violati ons of federal and state antitrust laws and California’ s unfair competition law based upon the Company’ s operation of its App Store. The\\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic’ s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’ s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provis ions of the Company’ s App Store Review Guid elines violate California’ s unfair competition law and issued an\\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Compan y is subject to other legal proceedi ngs and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’ s financial\\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.

The Company\\nintends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of finan cial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generall y accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’ s\\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’ s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that\\naffect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’ s consolidated financial statements. Management\\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain T ax Positions\\nThe Company is subjec t to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’ s uncertain tax positions involves\\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP  and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the\\nallocation of international taxation rights between  countries. Although management believes the Company’ s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’ s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’ s\\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject  to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amou nt is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\\nsignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matter s in a manner inconsistent with management’ s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’ s\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-k-2022.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\\nThe Compan y regularly reviews its foreign exch ange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with\\nits underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’ s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature\\nof the expos ures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign\\nexchange or interest rates. Further , the recognit ion of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely af fect the Company’ s financial condition and operating results.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Compa ny’s exposu re to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’ s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\\nexposed to global intere st rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\\nthe Company’ s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest\\npaid on the Company’ s debt.\\nThe Company’ s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’ s liquidity requirements. The Company\\nuses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically\\ninvests in highly rated securities, with the primar y objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’ s investment policy generally requires\\nsecurities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer . To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\\nassociated with the Company’ s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analys is to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have\\non the value of the investment portfolio assuming  a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and\\nSeptember 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental\\ndecline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively . Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity .\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate\\nnotes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion , respectively . The Company has entered, and in the future may\\nenter , into interest rate swaps to manage interes t rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate\\npayments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the\\ncorresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\\nCompany’ s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively .\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar . Accordingly , changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\\nthe U.S. dollar , will negatively affect the Company’ s net sales and gross margins as expressed  in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institu tions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\\nthe Compan y has entered, and in the future may enter , into foreign currency contracts to partia lly offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\\nforeign curre ncy–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However , the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\\nreasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-k-2022.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’ s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a\\nsensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a\\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\\nvalue, for a given confide nce interval, to the Company’ s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended\\nto represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model.

Intercompany\\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles require s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ\\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to\\nconform to the current period’ s presentation.\\nThe Compan y’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September . An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’ s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’ s fiscal year ending\\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company’ s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\\nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company’ s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it\\nexpects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present\\nright to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or servic es are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’ s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’ s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.\\nPayment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\\napplicable.\\nThe Compan y records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\\nCompany’ s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangem ents with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\\nSSPs. When  observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’ s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’ s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\\ncharged by the Compan y for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,  product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\\nprovide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified up to three perform ance obligations regularly included in arrangem ents involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-re lated bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri and Maps.\\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undeliv ered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’ s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled  software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer , which generally occurs when the product\\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\\nbasis over the estimate d period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated\\nwarranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are\\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly , the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.® ®\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34'),\n",

The State Aid Decision ordered\\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes  from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\\nJuly 15, 2020, the Gene ral Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’ s decision to\\nthe European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would\\nbe creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may reques t approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\\ncountries. As of Septem ber 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest.

The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below , providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\\nUncertain T ax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in\\nthe U.S. federal jurisdict ion and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of\\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s\\neffective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation\\nand application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\\nAuditing management’ s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\\non interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50'),\n",

In our opinion, Apple\\nInc. maintained, in all material respects, ef fective internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated\\nbalance sheets of Apple  Inc. as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,\\nshareholders’  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 24, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 27,\\n2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nApple Inc.’s managemen t is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\\nexpress an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\\nare required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit  in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether ef fective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances.

A company’ s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nOctober 27, 2022\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52'),\n",

Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’ s management, the Company’ s principal executive officer and principal\\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Compa ny’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\\nwere effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\\nsubmits under the Exch ange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within  the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’ s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’ s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’ s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \\n(i) pertain to the maintenan ce of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’ s\\nassets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\\nGAAP , and that the Company’ s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’ s management\\nand directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assu rance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’ s assets\\nthat could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’ s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’ s internal controls will prevent or\\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\\nobjectives of the control system are met. Furthe r, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\\ncontrols must be consid ered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’ s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting based on the\\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrate d Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\\nframework). Based on the Company’ s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\\nSeptember 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\\nwith GAAP . The Company’ s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’ s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with\\nmanagement’ s evaluatio n required by paragraph  (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exch ange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\\nto materially af fect, the Company’ s internal control over financial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': '10-Q4-2024-As-Filed.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Note  2 – Revenue\\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is \\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue \\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \\nnet sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024 , 2023  and 2022  were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489 \\nMac  29,984  29,357  40,177 \\niPad  26,694  28,300  29,292 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories  37,005  39,845  41,241 \\nServices (1) 96,169  85,200  78,129 \\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sale s price of certain p roducts.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion  of revenue recognized in 2024  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, \\n2023 , $8.2 billion  of revenue recognized in 2023  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022 , and $7.5 \\nbillion  of revenue recognized in 2022  that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021 .\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 35'),\n",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at \\nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, \\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

Net sales for \\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in \\nthose geographic locations.

Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa01, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024  Form 10-K | 50')]"

The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as throughthird-party\\n cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatibleproducts,\\n including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sizedbusinesses and education, enterpri\\nse and government customers.Basis of Presentation\\n and PreparationThe\\n accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Inthe\\n opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessaryfor\\n fair  financial  statement  presentation.  The  preparation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accountingprinciples\\n (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements andaccompanying notes. Actual resu\\nlts could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have beenreclassified to conform to the \\ncurrent period’s presentation.The\\n Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 -week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ended on \\nSeptember 24, 2016 , September 26, 2015 and  September  27, 2014 ,  respectively, and each spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the firstfiscal\\n quarter approximately every five or six years to  realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will next occur in the first quarter of the Company'sfiscal\\n year ending September 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscalyears ended in September and the associated qua\\nrters, months and periods of those fiscal years.During\\n 2016,  the  Company  adopted  an  accounting  standard  that  simplified  the  presentation  of  deferred  income  taxes  by  requiring  deferred  tax  assets  andliabilities\\n be  classified  as  noncurrent  in  a  classified  statement  of  financial  position.  The  Company  has  adopted  this  accounting  standard  prospectively;accordingly,\\n the prior period amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within this Annual Report on Form 10-K were not adjusted to conform tothe new accounting standard. The adoption of this a\\nccounting standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition\\nNet\\n sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. TheCompany recognizes\\n revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectionis probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been\\n shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Formost\\n of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to educationcustomers\\n in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portionof\\n the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as paymentsbecome\\n due  unless  the  Company  has  positive  evidence  that  the  sales  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  such  as  a  successful  history  of  collection,  withoutconcession,\\n on  comparable  arrangements.  The  Company  recognizes  revenue  from  the  sale  of  hardware  products,  software  bundled  with  hardware  that  isessential\\n to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accountingguidance.\\n The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:(i) standalone\\n sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of thehardware.\\nFor\\n the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishesits\\n own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk foramounts\\n billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunesStore,\\n the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts forsuch\\n sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that isremitted\\n by  the  Company  to  third-party  app  developers  and  certain  digital  content  owners  is  not  reflected  in  the  Company’s  Consolidated  Statements  ofOperations.\\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \\n44 \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '10k-2016.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amountsthat\\n have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products.The\\n Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TVApp Store and iBooks Store for the purcha\\nse of digital content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relievedupon\\n redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverageperiods.\\n AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic toolsoffered under the Company’s standard l\\nimited warranty.The\\n Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactionsinvolving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount\\n to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs,the\\n estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program isoffered.\\n The  Company  also  records  reductions  to  revenue  for  expected  future  product  returns  based  on  the  Company’s  historical  experience.  Revenue  isrecorded net\\n of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remittedto the relevant government authority.\\nRevenue\\nRecognition\\nfor\\nArr\\nangements\\nwith\\nMultiple\\nDeliverablesFor\\n multi-element  arrangements  that  include  hardware  products  containing  software  essential  to  the  hardware  product’s  functionality,  undelivered  softwareelements\\n that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverablesbased\\n on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue todeliverables:\\n (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price(“ESP”).\\n VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.ESPs\\n reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. For multi-elementarrangements accounted\\n for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on theVSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not e\\nxist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.For sales of qualifying versions of\\n iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide futureunspecified\\n software  upgrades  to  the  device’s  essential  software  and/or  non-software  services  free  of  charge.  The  Company  has  identified  up  to three deliverables regular\\nly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion of the allocatedsales\\n price,  is  the  hardware  and  software  essential  to  the  functionality  of  the  hardware  device  delivered  at  the  time  of  sale.  The  second  deliverable  is  theembedded\\n right  included  with  qualifying  devices  to  receive  on  a  when-and-if-available  basis,  future  unspecified  software  upgrades  relating  to  the  product’sessential\\n software.  The  third  deliverable  is  the  non-software  services  to  be  provided  to  qualifying  devices.  The  Company  allocates  revenue  between  thesedeliverables using\\n the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is basedon\\n the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the otherconditions\\n for revenue recognition have been met.

Di\\nluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number ofshares of\\n common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstandingif the\\n potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased by employees underthe\\n Company’s employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected indiluted\\n earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method.

The Company’s marketable debtand\\n equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments atthe\\n time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-termor\\n long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified asshort-term\\n and marketable  debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term.  Marketable equity securities, including mutualfunds,\\n are classified as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. The Company’smarketable\\n debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated othercomprehensive\\n income  (“AOCI”)  in  shareholders’  equity,  with  the  exception  of  unrealized  losses  believed  to  be  other-than-temporary  which  are  reported  inearnings in the current period. The co\\nst of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.Derivative\\nFinancial\\nInstruments\\nThe Company accounts\\n for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.For\\n derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion ofthe\\n gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period orperiods\\n during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized inearnings\\n in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cashflows on hedged\\n transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectivenessand are recognized in earnings.\\nFor\\n derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both thenet gain or loss on the derivati\\nve instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.For\\n derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the netinvestment\\n in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument isreported\\n in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Companyexcludes changes\\n in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible \\nAssetsThe\\n Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible assetswith\\n indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carryingamount\\n of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cashflows\\n the  assets  are  expected  to  generate.  If  property,  plant  and  equipment,  inventory  component  prepayments  and  certain  identifiable  intangibles  areconsidered to be impaired, the i\\nmpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value.The\\n Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at leastannually\\n or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangibleasset\\n impairment  tests  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  each  year.  The  Company  did  not  recognize  any  impairment  charges  related  to  goodwill  or  indefinite  livedintangible\\n assets during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .  For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company established reporting units based on its currentreporting structure. Goodwi\\nll has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2016 and 2015 , the Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Am\\nericas and Europe reporting units.The\\n Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Companytypically amortizes its acquired inta\\nngible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years . Fair Value Measurements\\nThe\\n Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fairvalue\\n in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in\\n an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets andliabilities,\\n which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous  market in which the Company wouldtransact\\n and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability, such as risks inherent invaluation techniques, transfer restrictions and\\n credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measurefair\\n value into  three  levels and  bases  the  categorization  within the  hierarchy upon  the  lowest level of  input that  is available  and significant  to  the fair valuemeasurement:\\nLevel\\n1\\n– Quoted prices in ac tive markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level\\n2\\n–  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilitiesin inactive markets,\\n or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level\\n\\n3\\n–  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing theasset or liability.\\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \\n48 '),\n",

Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and lossesfrom\\n these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity.

The matur\\nities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years . The\\n Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically investsin\\n highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments tobe\\n investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in theinvestment\\n portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent towhich\\n fair  value  has  been  below  its  cost  basis,  the  financial  condition  of  the  issuer  and  any  changes  thereto,  changes  in  market  interest  rates  and  theCompany’s\\n intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis.

There can be noassurance the hedges will off\\nset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.To\\n help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S.dollar\\n may  hedge  a  portion  of  forecasted  foreign  currency  revenue,  and  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is  not  the  U.S.  dollar  and  who  sell  in  localcurrencies\\n may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter intoforward\\n contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.

The  credit  risk  amounts  represent  the  Company’s  gross  exposure  to  potential  accounting  loss  on  derivativeinstruments\\n that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency orinterest\\n rates  at  each  respective  date.  The  Company’s  exposure  to  credit  loss  and  market  risk  will  vary  over  time  as  currency  and  interest  rates  change.Although\\n the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associatedwith the\\n exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments,together with the gains and losses on the unde\\nrlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.The\\n Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with thesame\\n counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received orposted\\n when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assetsand\\n derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivativeinstruments\\n under its collateral security arrangements  was $163  million as  of September  24, 2016 and $1.0 billion as  of September  26, 2015 ,  which wererecorded as accrued expenses in the \\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.Under\\n master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactionswith\\n a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September  24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 ,  the potential effects of these rights of set-offassociated\\n with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.5 billion \\nand $2.2 billion , respectively, result ing in a net derivative asset of  $160 million and a net derivative  liability of $78 million , respectively. Accounts Receivable\\nTrade\\nReceivables\\nThe\\n Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, smalland\\n mid-sized  businesses  and  education,  enterprise  and  government  customers.  The  Company  generally  does  not  require  collateral  from  its  customers;however, the\\n Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on tradereceivables\\n with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financingarrangements\\n are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse orcredit risk sharing \\nrelated to any of these arrangements.As of \\nSeptember 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 , the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accountedfor \\n10% and 12% ,  respectively.

The\\n Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. During the fourthquarter\\n of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its examination of the years 2010 through2012.\\n In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financialstatements.\\n All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to auditsby\\n state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could besubject to examination by the tax\\ning authorities.The\\n Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of taxaudits\\n cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations, theCompany\\n could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

The State Aid Decision ordersIreland\\n to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as ofthe\\n beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.

Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State AidDecision.\\n While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13  billion ,  plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject torecovery\\n is  to  be  calculated  by  Ireland  in  accordance  with  the  European  Commission\\'s  guidance.  Once  the  recovery  amount  is  computed  by  Ireland,  theCompany\\n anticipates  funding  it,  including  interest,  out  of  foreign  cash  into  escrow,  pending  conclusion  of  all  appeals.

Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could besubject\\n to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, therewas\\n not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system orapplication software for in\\nfringement of third-party intellectual property rights.The\\n Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China.The\\n iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certainconditions\\n are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such rightwith subsequent changes to the guarantee liab\\nility recognized within revenue.The\\n Company  has  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  its  directors  and  executive  officers.  Under  these  agreements,  the  Company  has  agreed  toindemnify\\n such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses\\n incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of paymentsthe\\n Company  could  be  required  to  make  under  these  agreements  due  to  the  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances\\n involved  in  each  claim.  However,  the  Company  maintains  directors  and  officers  liability  insurance  coverage  to  reduce  its  exposure  to  suchobligations.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of \\nSupply of Materials and ProductAlthough\\n most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtainedfrom\\n single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication andmedia\\n devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are attimes\\n subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operatingresults.\\nThe\\n Company  uses  some  custom  components  that  are  not  commonly  used  by  its  competitors,  and  new  products  introduced  by  the  Company  often  utilizecustom\\n components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new  technologies,  initial  capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  thesuppliers’\\n yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed orconstrained,\\n or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating resultscould\\n be materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the timerequired\\n to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability ofthese\\n components  at  acceptable  prices,  or  at  all,  may  be  affected  if  those  suppliers  concentrated  on  the  production  of  common  components  instead  ofcomponents customized to meet the Compan\\ny’s requirements.The Company\\n has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew\\n these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases thatcould materially adversely affec\\nt its financial condition and operating results.Substantially\\n all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration ofthis manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these\\n outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers\\n of components and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners onmanufacturing\\n schedules,  the  Company’s  operating  results  could  be  adversely  affected  if  its  outsourcing  partners  were  unable  to  meet  their  productioncommitments.
